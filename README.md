spt is a utility that allows any SCSI command to be issued. It is used for both
negative and positive SCSI testing, is multi-threaded, supports scripts, and allows
I/O parameters for I/O operations (read, write, verift, etc). It is built on top
of a SCSI library which supports multiple operating systems: AIX, HP-UX, Linux,
Solaris, VMware, and Windows.

The latest spt support Storage Enclosure Services (SES) diagnostic pages in both
ASCII and JSON formats. Several disk related commands are also available in JSON,
such as Inquiry, Serial Number, and Device Identification pages.
