spt is a utility that allows any SCSI command to be issued. It is used for both
negative and positive SCSI testing, is multi-threaded, supports scripts, and allows
I/O parameters for I/O operations (read, write, verift, etc). It is built on top
of a SCSI library which supports multiple operating systems: AIX, HP-UX, Linux,
Solaris, VMware, and Windows.
